                                <li>In a medium saucepan, bring 1 inch (2.5cm) of water to a gentle simmer over medium heat
                                    Place a heatproof bowl on top of the pot making sure the bowl does not touch the water.

                                <li>Let's start off by preparing our food. First of cut you bagel in half length ways so
                                    that
                                    you have two circular halfs. Then slice the mushrooms roughly.</li>
                                <li>Next add some oil to a frying pan on and put on a medium heat.</li>
                                <li>Add your bacon to the pan and leave it alone to cook on the first side for about 8
                                    minuets,
                                    then flip them over and cook for the same time. After you have flipped
                                    the bacon add the mushrooms into the same pan and start frying them off.
                                </li>
                                <li>When you have about 3 minuets left for the bacon move them tothe side of the frying pan
                                    with
                                    your mushrooms. Next crack both eggs into the other side of the frying pan
                                    and let them start to cook. At this point you can now put your bagel halfs into the
                                    toaster.
                                </li>
                                <li>Watch you bacon mushrooms and eggs and turn off the heat when you are happy with how
                                    they
                                    are cooked.</li>
                                <li>Assembling is the easiest part. Take your toasted bagles halfs add themto your plate and
                                    apread butter (if prefered), at a little bit of suace and spread evenly.
                                    Take the bacon out first and add two pieces to each half. Lay your egg on top next. Then
                                    finish with your fried mushrooms.
                                </li>
